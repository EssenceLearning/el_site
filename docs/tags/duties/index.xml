      <description>Cabin crew are also known as Flight Attendants, Air Hostess, Flight Stewards or even trolley dolly&amp;rsquo;s! They are primarily on board an aircraft for the safety and welfare of the passengers and secondly for their comfort. If there were no services of food or drink during a flight, there would still have to be a minimum presence of cabin crew for safety, which is a legal requirement.
Because cabin crew members are the face of the airline they are expected to excel in customer service and always remain friendly, approachable and enthusiastic with a good sense of self-presentation.</description>
