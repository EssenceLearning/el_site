      <description>Recruitment Process The recruitment process for the majority of airlines follow a common pattern: application forms or CVâ€™s are received either online or by post. Candidates are then short-listed and invited for an interview.
The interview format will normally consist of an introduction about the airline, group work, English or maths written tests and finally a face to face interview with a panel of the interviewers. Some airlines may also require you to conduct a short presentation, details of any presentations will be explained in the invitation letter for the interview.</description>
