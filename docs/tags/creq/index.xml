      <description>Hierarchy of Flight Crew
Hierarchy varies from one airline to the other. Aircraft Crew is divided into two groups- Cockpit Crew and Cabin Crew. As an Aircraft Crew, there is a captain/ Pilot/ Commander, a first officer/ Co- Pilot, possibly a second officer (or another first officer) in the cockpit then a senior cabin crew member (different airlines use different designators) and other junior crew in the cabin. Depending on the airline, more senior crew is in charge of a particular class of travel, than junior cabin crew.</description>
