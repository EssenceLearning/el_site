                          <p>Here&rsquo;s a quick help with most frequent queries from our visitors -</p>
<h3 id="1-i-cannot-speak-an-additional-language-is-this-going-to-hold-me-back-from-being-hired-as-a-cabin-crew-airport-staff">1. I cannot speak an additional language, is this going to hold me back from being hired as a cabin crew/ Airport staff?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Not at all, speaking additional language is not essential to become a cabin crew/ Airport staff, although it is desirable. However fluency in English and Hindi is a must for domestic Airlines. For international Air Carriers, Fluency in English is mandatory and knowledge of any regional or foreign language is an added advantage.</p>

<h3 id="2-i-never-excelled-at-school-am-i-eligible-to-get-hired-as-an-airline-crew-or-hotel-staff">2. I never excelled at school, am i eligible to get hired as an Airline Crew or Hotel Staff?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The industry understand that not every prospective candidates excels at school, but have the required skills and qualities to fit in the requirements. If you did not manage to gain a distinction in your subjects but have cleared higher secondary education or have customer service experience then they will still consider you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="3-do-i-have-to-live-close-to-the-airport-that-i-would-be-based-at-whilst-working-as-cabin-crew-airport-staff">3. Do I have to live close to the airport that I would be based at whilst working as cabin crew/ Airport staff?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The candidate will be required to live within a certain distance from the airport they are based at. The majority of airlines set a distance of maximum of a 60 minute travel time radius. This is mainly because the candidate can be rostered on standby which means that they may get called for work at a short notice. Apart from this, it is much better to be close to the airport as there is nothing more tiring than finishing a long hour shift and then have to drive a long way back home!</p>
