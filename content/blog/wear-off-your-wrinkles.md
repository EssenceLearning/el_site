Although all of us age, we can slow down wrinkles and keep our skin smooth and young for a long time by giving it both meticulous care and attention from both within and outside.  Looking young is an essential part of the hospitality career. Dry skin is the chief cause of facial wrinkles. Dry skin requires constant attention over a period of months to turn it into a supple skin.

Start first with a correct diet. Take 4 to 5 tablespoons of butter, ghee or oil in your diet. Besides, take Vitamins A & E in the form of tablets. Vitamin E pill when crushed and applied to a dry and wrinkled skin works wonders on it. In addition to taking a correct diet, instead of cleaning your face with soap and water, clean with a milk cleanser. Warm 3 tablespoon of milk together with 1 tablespoon of your favorite oil, dip cotton balls in it and clean your face and neck with it, you will be surprised to see that it removes dirt better then any cleansing cream. Rinse your face then apply a thin film of oil to the skin to seal in the moisture. Dry skin is also the sign of Vitamin A deficiency. Excessive exposure to sunlight creates a drying effect on the skin so avoid stepping out in the sun unless absolute necessary.

Besides correct diet and outer maintenance of the skin you must also exercise your facial muscles. The firmness and quantity of the facial skin is determined by the underlying muscles which support your face. With regular face lifting exercise you can easily cheat on those wrinkles, well and cheat on your interviewer too.
