Both uncorrected and corrected visual acuity are normally measured and recorded at each re-examination conditions which indicate a need to obtain an ophthalmic report include

1. a substantial decrease in the uncorrected visual acuity, and
2. any decrease in best corrected visual acuity, and
3. the occurrence of eye disease, eye injury or eye surgery.

Applicants may use contact lenses to meet their visual requirements provided that:

1. the lenses are monofocal and non-tinted.
2. the lenses are well tolerated, and
3. a pair of suitable correcting spectacles is kept readily available during the exercise of the licence privileges (Note: Applicants who used contact lenses may not need to have their uncorrected visual acuity measured at each re-examination provided the history of their contact lenses prescription is known).
4. Applicants with a large refractive error shall use contact lenses or high index spectacle lenses (Note: If spectacles are used, high index lenses are needed to minimize peripheral field distortion).
5. Applicants whose uncorrected distant visual acuity in either eye is worse than 6160, shall be required to provide a full ophthalmic report prior to initial Medical Assessment and every Five years thereafter.<br /> Note:-

The purpose of the required ophthalmic examination is:

* to ascertain normal visual performance and
* to identify any significant pathology
