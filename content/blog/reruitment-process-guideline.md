#### Recruitment Process

The recruitment process for the majority of airlines follow a common pattern: application forms or CV’s are received either online or by post.  Candidates are then short-listed and invited for an interview.

The interview format will normally consist of an introduction about the airline, group work, English or maths written tests and finally a face to face interview with a panel of the interviewers.  Some airlines may also require you to conduct a short presentation, details of any presentations will be explained in the invitation letter for the interview.

**Your CV layout**

CV’s should be simply laid out over no more than two pages.  Check the accuracy of your grammar and spelling.

Airlines like easy to read CV’s that are easy to navigate around.  Using  relevant headings, short paragraphs and bullet points can all help to create an eye catching CV.  Airlines typically don’t read everything on your CV and their first glance could only be a few seconds.  An over complicated CV may not get a second chance.

Graphics and gimmicks should be avoid and using tables and charts can make a CV look cluttered.  Overall try to use a consistent, professional style and don’t overdo the underlining or capital letters!
