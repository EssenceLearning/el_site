text: "Essence learning itself is an essence to the students who are looking for a glamorous and challenging field in Aviation . It is a path for a bright future for the passionate students . I highly appreciate the faculties, they are very cooperative and friendly . Godhuli ma'am is one of the best trainers and hats off for guiding young generation for a better tomorrow.. The way faculties teaches and motivates the students is the best part of essence learning . I see Essence Learning spreading its essence all over Bangalore and India soon :)"
