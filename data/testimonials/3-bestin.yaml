text: "I already finished my Aviation course with Frankfinn but failed to bag a relevant job for myself for years. Thing missing in other institutes was correct guidance and motivation. I then came to know about Essence Learning, was not convinced about undergoing training again but i trusted and was really given a strong industry training. I gained confidence through their motivation and support and cleared my Indigo interview with other two friends from Kerela. Four of my kerela friend couldn't clear this time but they continued their training and today all of them are placed with Spicejet."
